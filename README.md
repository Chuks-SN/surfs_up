# Overview of The Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to get more information regarding temperature trends before opening a surf shop in Oahu. More specifically, we've been tasked with getting temperature data for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable all year round.

# Results 

#### One
From the results seen, the minmum temperature in June was 64 degree and for December, it was 56 degrees. While the mean temperatures were approximately 75 and 71 degrees respectively. 

#### Two
The maximum temperature for both months were almost within the same range. June had a mximum temperature of 85, while December had 83 degrees. 

#### Three
The count for June was 1700, which means more data, and that of December was 1517. There was a difference in the standard deviation for both months, June had a std of approximately 3.3 and December had approximately 3.7

# Summary

Considering the mean temperatures between the months of June and December, the temperature in Oahu seems consistent. The reletively high maximum temperatures for both months indicate that the city is a good place for a surf/ice cream shop. However, more information about the time or period of day the high temperature sets in might be useful. 

Temperarute fluctuations in Oahu for the two months analyzed don't seem too different, that might be an indication that the atmosphere is pretty consistent all year-around. However, it might be safer to consider data from the full year to ensure that we have enough information for this business venture.
